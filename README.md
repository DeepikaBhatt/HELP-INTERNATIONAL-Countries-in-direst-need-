# HELP INTERNATIONAL (Countries in direst need)


## Problem Statement
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes.

After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid. 

And this is where you come in as a data analyst. Your job is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most. 

## Observations
1) The CEO of the NGO should majorly focus on the countries with low gdpp. Since most of the other factors such as imports, exports, health and income is highly correlated with the gdpp factor.

2) NGO should also focus on the countries with high child mortality. Child mortality is highly positively correlated with total fertility and negatively correlated with life expectancy factor, therefore, no need to look after the other two variables.

3) Since countries with less imports and exports will not have source of income from this major sector which helps in improving economy of the country, therefore, countries with less exports and imports of goods and services per capita should also be considered.

4) All other factors are highly correlated with child mortality and gdpp, therefore, CEO should focus on the countries with high child mortality and low gdpp only.

5) Countries which are in direst need of aid are - "Burundi", "Liberia", "Congo, Dem.Rep", "Niger", "Sierra Leone".
